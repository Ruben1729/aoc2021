# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event that lasts for a month.
During this month, 2 programming puzzles are posted on a daily basis and people are rated based on how fast they solve
these problems. This repository holds all of my solutions in python to Advent of Code 2021.
